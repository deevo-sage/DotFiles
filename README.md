# Sid's dotfiles

My Macos dotfiles. contains both my tmux config and neovim config

## tmux

copied and modified a bit <a href='https://github.com/olimorris' >Olimorris</a>. More minimal Catpucchin themed one in tmux-2.conf. Found his config when was looking at
<a href='https://github.com/olimorris/tmux-pomodoro-plus'>tmux-pomodoro-plus</a> plugin and was like damn i want that XD.

## neovim

First started with a very minimal one then shifted to a mix of <a href='https://github.com/ThePrimeagen' >ThePrimeagen's</a> & <a href='https://github.com/craftzdog' >craftzdog's</a>config and then made many shitty updates. now have shifted to using LSP Zero because it gives great TS support right out of the box.
used to use coc-nvim but damn that shit fills ram like crazy. // just a rant XD
